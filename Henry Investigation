Dear Kate,
I can still fondly remember
the time we spent together
hanging out…
I wanted to send you a gift
you couldn’t hold at the time. Hope you enjoy it!
With love, Henry

To midnight’s Kate,
What do you wish for when
you look up at the night sky?
I wish for someone special
to be there watching the
stars with me.  Who’s the
special someone? I wonder…
From believer Henry

To Kate,
Uh, sorry for coming over so
suddenly the other day.
I’m sending this present as a
thank-you for sharing your
time! It’s just something to
spice up your daily life…
Spatial designer, Henry

Good luck, Kate!
These shoes are for you. I
don’t think anything special
is going to happen if they’re
a perfect fit, but wouldn’t it
be so nice if something did!
Talk about a fairy-tale story!
Fairy godfather Henry

To Kate,
I’m sorry for coming over all
of a sudden the other day!
As an apology, I’m sending
you a present. I hope you
like it… Please like it!
Or not.
From Henry

Dear Kate,
Somehow, I start thinking of
you every time I listen to
Comrade K.K. at
home. It just came on, and
before I realized it, I was
writing this letter… Weird…
Fleeting love’s Henry

Dear Kate,
My heart yearns with every
sunset.  It’s as if the sun and I
have broken hearts together.
My love was so pure, but
now it’s over before it ever
had a chance to really begin.
The lonely Henry

Dear Kate,
Thanks for coming over the
other day. Here’s a present
I couldn’t give you then.
Next time I won’t be so
forgiving when you say my
room just looks OK!
With love, Henry
